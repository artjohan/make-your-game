# Make your game

The instructions for this task were to create a working video game with only plain JS and HTML. The use of frameworks and canvas was not allowed.

# Usage

To run the program at the default 8080 port, use `go run .`

If you wish to use a different port, you can add a valid port number as an argument.

Ex. `go run . 5000`

# Game instructions

Use the arrow keys to move around, up to jump and down to crouch. You can also press P or ESC to pause.

Gather all the coins to win, but be quick, because the faster you are the more bonus points you get.

You can jump on the ghosts to stun them, but if they touch you when they're moving, you lose a life.

If you run out of lives or the timer hits 0, you die.

There are 4 difficulty options to choose from.

# Testing

[Here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/make-your-game/audit) are the audit questions to test the program.
